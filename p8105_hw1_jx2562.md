# Problem 1

Here we use ggplot to scatter the correlation between *temp* and
*time_hour* in the **early_january_weather** data frame, with *humid*
indicating the color of the points.

Load the libraries (**moderndive** and **tidyverse**) and dataset
(**early_january_weather**) we are going to use.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The data frame gives the detailed information about the weather in the
early Janurary. The variables in the dataset includes *origin, year,
month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust,
precip, pressure, visib, time_hour*.

The means for *temp* and *humid* are 39.58 and 65.48.

The standard deviation for *temp* and *humid* are 7.06 and 18.95.

The start *time_hour* is 2013-01-01 01:00:00 and it ends at 2013-01-15
23:00:00

The dataset **early_january_weather** include 15 columns and 358 rows.

The first five rows of the dataset are given below.

``` r
head(early_january_weather)
```

    ## # ℹ 4 more variables: precip <dbl>, pressure <dbl>, visib <dbl>,
    ## #   time_hour <dttm>

Here we make a scatterplot of *temp* and *time_hour* with color
indicating the *humid*.

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

It is apparent from the graph that as time pass by, the temperature grew
gradually with fluctuation. In terms of humidity, it rose up with the
temperature and reached its summit in January 14.

# Problem 2

Here we created a dataframe including *numeric*, *boolean*, *character*,
and *factor* variables. Then, some operations were conducted on the
dataframe to help us better comprehend these concepts in R.

First, we created a data frame containing:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0

- a character vector of length 10

- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = tibble(
  std_norm = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = std_norm > 0,
  char_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  factor_vec = factor(sample(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), size = 10, replace = TRUE))
)
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    std_norm logical_vec char_vec factor_vec
    ##       <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    0.942 TRUE        A        Medium    
    ##  2   -0.750 FALSE       B        Low       
    ##  3    1.41  TRUE        C        High      
    ##  4   -0.832 FALSE       D        Medium    
    ##  5    0.909 TRUE        E        Medium    
    ##  6   -0.297 FALSE       F        High      
    ##  7   -0.520 FALSE       G        High      
    ##  8    0.140 TRUE        H        High      
    ##  9   -0.395 FALSE       I        Medium    
    ## 10    0.450 TRUE        J        Low

This below code chunk took the mean of each column and saw how it goes.

``` r
mean_std_norm <- mean(df %>% pull(std_norm))
mean_logical <- mean(df %>% pull(logical_vec))
mean_char <- mean(df %>% pull(char_vec))
mean_factor <- mean(df %>% pull(factor_vec))
mean_std_norm
```

    ## [1] 0.1052332

``` r
mean_logical
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean_char
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean_factor
```

    ## [1] NA

We can take the mean of *numeric* and *logical* data, but not
*character* and *factor* variables. Instead, an NA was introduced.

``` r
num_logical <- as.numeric(df %>% pull(logical_vec))
num_char <- as.numeric(df %>% pull(char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor <- as.numeric(df %>% pull(factor_vec))
```

Except for character variable, the other two data types can be converted
to *numeric* data. The result coincided with taking the mean except for
the *factor* variable. Factor variables were discrete labels but not
numbers, so we cannot take their means. The function `mean()` will not
convert the *factor* variables and *character* variable to *numeric*
data first. If we want to calculate the mean of factor variable, we can
convert it to *numeric* data with `as.numeric()`.
